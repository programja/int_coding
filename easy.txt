Problem definitions above solution, will notify when sub- or optimal per performance/space.
Per how to approach:

Start with easy problems (maybe one month, 20 - 30 problems, top-100 liked/interview questions);
Per interviews: Stick to medium
Best ones - Top 100 liked problems;
Start with easy -> hard DS (arrays, stack, queue -> heaps);
Dont spend in one problem hours and hours, look at the solution

Create a repo for the solutions

1. Problem definition: Two Sum
Given: Array of integers and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
One solution, cannot use the same element twice.

Solution:
A) Could be quicker.

class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {

        int nLength = nums.length;
        int[] ansArray = new int[2];

        for (int i=0; i < nLength; i++) {
            for (int j = i+1; j < nLength; j++) {
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                    ansArray[0] = i;
                    ansArray[1] = j;
                }
            }
        }

        return ansArray;
    }
}
